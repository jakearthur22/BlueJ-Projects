each card will be a new txt file. use the layout provided by java.awt.FlowLayout toString() method as a template!

modify this to add index cards:
public void addEntry(KantoDex entry)
  {
    if(entries.isEmpty())
    {
      entries.add(entry);
    }
    else
    {
      boolean notFound = true;
      for(KantoDex entryInit : entries)
      {
        if(entry.getDexNumInt() == entryInit.getDexNumInt())
        {
          System.out.println("Error: Attempted to add an entry that already exists, or should not exist.");
          notFound = false;
        }
      }
      if(notFound)
      {
        entries.add(entry);
      }
    }
  }
